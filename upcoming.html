          <p class="text-muted">October 24th, 2019 at 7 p.m.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">The Choral Artists of Michigan are pleased to present a collaborative concert with the Lake Orion Baptist Senior High Singers of Dan Forrest’s Jubilate Deo at 7 p.m. on Thursday, October 24, at the First Baptist Church – Lake Orion, 255 E Scripps Rd, Lake Orion 48359.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">This new work brings the global aspect of the Psalm 100 text to life. Forrest arranges seven different languages, drawing from a wide spectrum of musical influences. Each movement features a different national musical style. In a single work, the audience will experience music inspired by Africa, Israel, China, and Spain. This is CAM first, and it begins a realization of their mission to collaborate with youth choruses for educational outreach.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">At the performance, the LOBS Senior High Singers will announce an exciting invitation to perform at the Lincoln Center in New York City. The Senior High Singers will travel to New York in March 2020 for a special performance of the Jubilate Deo with the composer in residence, Dan Forrest, at the piano in the world-famous Lincoln Center stage.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">Admission to Jubilate Deo is free and open to the public. A free-will offering will be taken at the conclusion of the concert. All funds will go to offset student costs of the Senior High Singers to NYC 2020 trip.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">The CAM Chamber Singers are comprised of local vocal music artists that sing professionally throughout the communities of Metro Detroit; members are drawn from the choristers of the Michigan Opera Theatre and paid choral scholars. This ensemble performs choral masterworks and features new works by living composers. The Community Chorus is a choral ensemble open to community members that are passionate about the choral art. The choir enrolls a diverse membership, and they perform varied works. The combined choirs are under the direction of Dr. Jim Watson, Artistic Director, with piano accompaniment by Hannah Watson. In addition, the choirs are accompanied by a chamber ensemble: Rachel Werner, flute; Donna Hobson, oboe; Carl Hemak, clarinet; Kate Watson, violin; and Melody Mieczkowski, cello.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">The Choral Artists of Michigan is a professional choral organization that engages audiences through outstanding experiences in vocal music. Their mission includes recording choral masterworks and organizing music festivals for educational outreach.</p>

          <h2 class="border-bottom mb-0">Song of Freedom</h2>
          <p class="text-muted">Q2 2020</p>
          <!-- <h4>Project Description</h4> -->
          <p class="text-muted">The Song of Freedom Choral Festival is a collaborative artistic experience that features the Choral Artists of Michigan Chamber Singers, Community Chorus, and an invited youth chorus, the Macomb Children’s Choruses. Our goal is to educate and inspire our communities through the performance of American masterworks, making choral music accessible to new and young audiences.</p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">We will accomplish this goal by providing an outstanding festival experience where we premiere two choral works by J.A.C. Redford, Musica Dei Donum Optimi and Do You Bring Hurt to My Table. In addition, we showcase and cultivate these students’ musical achievement through the preparation and performance of this exciting American music. We collaborate with all choirs combined on J.A.C. Redford’s Let Beauty Be Our Memorial. That is, at the conclusion of the festival, students will join with adult singers and professional musicians, producing a memorable once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
          <!-- <h4>Importance Explained</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">The CAM pursues engaging projects that educate and inspire. When students hear and collaborate with highly-skilled, professional singers, the aesthetic experience is unmatched. Choral collaborations inspire performers and audiences, contributing beauty and shared community.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">By definition, choirs are collaborators. That is, individual choir members are part of a larger whole. Educational outcomes include teamwork, leadership, musical achievement, and social acceptance. We collaborate across a diverse spectrum of ages. Older singers serve as mentors to these young artists; two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. The collaboration unifies a community, allowing individuals to achieve together. Our goal, then, includes developing a choral greenhouse of collaborative community that mimics the need for societal collaboration.</p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">The performance of diverse, older American works allows audiences to hear the story of music through time. The study of music history lets us understand musical developments and how our current music field came to be. This pursuit progresses the community into a future that contributes important music for the next generations.</p> -->
