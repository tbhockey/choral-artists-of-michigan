          <h4>Project Description</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">The Song of Freedom Choral Festival is a collaborative artistic experience that features the Choral Artists of Michigan Chamber Singers, Community Chorus, and an invited youth chorus, the Macomb Children’s Choruses. Our goal is to educate and inspire our communities through the performance of American masterworks, making choral music accessible to new and young audiences.</p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">We will accomplish this goal by providing an outstanding festival experience where we premiere two choral works by J.A.C. Redford, Musica Dei Donum Optimi and Do You Bring Hurt to My Table. In addition, we showcase and cultivate these students’ musical achievement through the preparation and performance of this exciting American music. We collaborate with all choirs combined on J.A.C. Redford’s Let Beauty Be Our Memorial. That is, at the conclusion of the festival, students will join with adult singers and professional musicians, producing a memorable once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
          <h4>Importance Explained</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">The CAM pursues engaging projects that educate and inspire. When students hear and collaborate with highly-skilled, professional singers, the aesthetic experience is unmatched. Choral collaborations inspire performers and audiences, contributing beauty and shared community.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">By definition, choirs are collaborators. That is, individual choir members are part of a larger whole. Educational outcomes include teamwork, leadership, musical achievement, and social acceptance. We collaborate across a diverse spectrum of ages. Older singers serve as mentors to these young artists; two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. The collaboration unifies a community, allowing individuals to achieve together. Our goal, then, includes developing a choral greenhouse of collaborative community that mimics the need for societal collaboration.</p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">The performance of diverse, older American works allows audiences to hear the story of music through time. The study of music history lets us understand musical developments and how our current music field came to be. This pursuit progresses the community into a future that contributes important music for the next generations.</p>
