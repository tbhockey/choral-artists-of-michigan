          <h2 class="border-bottom mb-0">Jubilate Deo</h2>
          <p class="text-muted">October 24th, 2019 at 7 p.m.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">The Choral Artists of Michigan are pleased to present a collaborative concert with the Lake Orion Baptist Senior High Singers of Dan Forrest’s Jubilate Deo at 7 p.m. on Thursday, October 24, at the First Baptist Church – Lake Orion, 255 E Scripps Rd, Lake Orion 48359.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">This new work brings the global aspect of the Psalm 100 text to life. Forrest arranges seven different languages, drawing from a wide spectrum of musical influences. Each movement features a different national musical style. In a single work, the audience will experience music inspired by Africa, Israel, China, and Spain. This is CAM first, and it begins a realization of their mission to collaborate with youth choruses for educational outreach.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">At the performance, the LOBS Senior High Singers will announce an exciting invitation to perform at the Lincoln Center in New York City. The Senior High Singers will travel to New York in March 2020 for a special performance of the Jubilate Deo with the composer in residence, Dan Forrest, at the piano in the world-famous Lincoln Center stage.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">Admission to Jubilate Deo is free and open to the public. A free-will offering will be taken at the conclusion of the concert. All funds will go to offset student costs of the Senior High Singers to NYC 2020 trip.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">The CAM Chamber Singers are comprised of local vocal music artists that sing professionally throughout the communities of Metro Detroit; members are drawn from the choristers of the Michigan Opera Theatre and paid choral scholars. This ensemble performs choral masterworks and features new works by living composers. The Community Chorus is a choral ensemble open to community members that are passionate about the choral art.
