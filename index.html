          <h2>Help Support Us</h2>
          <p class="text-muted">As with any new organization, the CAM financial needs are great. The organization is seeking grassroots support. In order to perform the 2020 projects, income is needed. That is, 2020 projects are currently underfunded. The Choral Artists of Michigan is a 501(c)(3) organization, so we will provide donation letters at the end of the year. Music Patron donations allow a concert venue, event insurance, print music, soloists, instrumentalists, publicity, and educational outreach.</p>
          <div class="collapse text-muted" id="collapseSupport">
            <p>As a supporter, you will get your name on our “Support” pages. Music Patrons (name in the program) -- $55. Gold Patrons (name in the program) -- $75 or above</p>
            <p>We will recognize your partnership in the printed program beginning at $55. Suggested donations are $55, $75, $150, or $500.</p>
            <h5 class="text-dark">Business Sponsors</h5>
            <p>By partnering with the CAM, your business will</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Establish association with a local, regionally recognized vocal music ensemble.</li>
              <li>Raise your community profile, visibility, and philanthropic vision.</li>
              <li>Make vocal music accessible to new and young audiences.</li>
              <li>Provide opportunity for children to succeed, achieve, and contribute to our community through the power of music.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="text-dark">Recognition and Reach</h5>
            <p>In addition, our partnership cultivates a relationship where your business is recognized. Our reach includes concerts at local performing arts centers.
