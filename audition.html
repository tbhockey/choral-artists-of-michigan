          <p>The Choral Artists of Michigan perform masterworks with a truncated rehearsal schedule. These rehearsals are based on the needs of each individual project. A typical masterwork would receive several hours of rehearsal over consecutive days the concert week, or we rehearse once weekly over three consecutive weeks. Singers are asked to come to the first rehearsal with parts carefully learned.</p>
          <p>The choral forces include both chamber ensembles and the full chorus. To audition for the Choral Artists of Michigan, please send a recording of your solo singing, a description of your singing background, and an optional resume to the Artistic Director. Audition selections from the classical tradition are preferred, but a recording of a simple hymn or song works well. Feel free to record on a phone or a tablet.</p>
          <p>Please send questions and audition materials to the Artistic Director, Jim Watson, over email at <a href="mailto:jwatson055@gmail.com">jwatson055@gmail.com</a>. Community Chorus members pay choir dues, and we provide a stipend to a small group of opera choristers that serve as the Chamber Singers.</p>
